## Under Construction
### Paused as of 11.20.24
I learned quite a lot getting as far as I did creating an interpreter with Rust - I built the scanning portion and abstract syntax tree, but got stuck at actual interpreting.  I am continuing an interpreter in python and I'll come back to this project when I've completed it, see [pylox](https://github.com/ostin-r/pylox)

Putting a goal on pause that I wanted to acheive is very tough, but trying to write a tree-walk interpreter in a language I have never used was a prime example of biting off more than I can chew.  I was still able to learn a lot by writing the tokenizer and parser, however the actual step of interpreting left a lot to be desired from my skills. I may pivot and write a similar interpreter in Python, then port it to Rust as my understanding grows.

rlox is an implementation of the "learning" programming language, lox, created by Robert Nystrom.  This implementation is created using Rust.
